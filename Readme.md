# Discover Bela-Bela 🌍
A community and tourism website that showcases the beauty, culture, and attractions of Bela-Bela in Limpopo, South Africa.

---

## 🌟 Overview
Discover Bela-Bela is a five-page website built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON**.  
It highlights key local attractions, community events, cultural activities, and provides an interactive contact section linked directly to WhatsApp.

This project demonstrates how dynamic data and interactivity can be achieved **without any backend**, making it lightweight, fast, and perfect for GitHub Pages hosting.

## 🧠 Features
- **Home Page:** Hero section with hot springs image and intro text  
- **Attractions Page:** Dynamic list of tourist spots fetched from `attractions.json`  
- **Events Page:** Upcoming community events loaded from `events.json`  
- **Culture Page:** Cultural highlights and artists pulled from `culture.json`, with YouTube video embeds loaded from `videos.json`  
- **Contact Page:** WhatsApp-linked contact form for real-time engagement

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – design and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – logic and dynamic rendering  
- **JSON** – mock backend for data  
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting and deployment

## 💬 How It Works
1. Each page fetches its own data from a JSON file using the `fetch()` API.  
2. The data is displayed dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.  
3. YouTube video URLs are fetched from `videos.json` and embedded automatically.  
4. The contact form connects to WhatsApp via a `wa.me` link, allowing instant communication.
